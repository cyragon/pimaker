Installation

1) Binary installation

The prefered way is to install one of the binary installation packages.
You find the latest downloads here: http://www.repetier.com/download/

2) Compile from source

You need a .NET ide with c# compiler. The software is developed using 
Visual Studio 2008. Any later version will work as well. Also an installation
of the latest OpenTK version (http://www.opentk.com) is needed.

Step 1: Open RepetierHost.sln in src/RepetierHost

Step 2: Build binary

Step 3: Now you have a binary in bin/Debug or bin/Release. The binary expects
  some files in the directory from where it runs. You need to copy them into
  this directory. Most important is the data directory found in src. You can
  also copy the Slic3r binary there if wanted. The main Folder must be named 
  Slic3r with no version numbers etc. You should also copy the OpenTK binary
  and configuration files in that directory.

  
Now you can start the application be starting it in debug mode (F5).
